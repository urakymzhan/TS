# TS

- [Docs](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book)

### Benefits:

    - Create with entities (on top of arrays, objects etc in js)
    - catch errors in compile-time
    - helps to arcitech your code better than vanilla js

### Cons:

    - Needs to be transpiled to js (can't be run in browser)
    - by default ts will transpile to ES3 (var etc supported)
